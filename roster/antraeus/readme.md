####About:
>I hail from Seattle, Washington originally, but have spent time around the globe, here and there. Grew up with a mixed-bag of computer science skills just from growing up during the 90's and the subsequent internet sub-cultures that rose from that; it was a blast: ran a MUD server, played many a MUD, UBBed it up, contributed to a design-focused hub for teens @ [DAZED.ORG](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.dazed.org "Way Back Mahine"), having volunteered my time and creativity in many disparate internet communities. 

>As for where I draw my knowledge and skills from presently - it's also a mixed-bag. I completed an AA at Bellevue College and dabbled in a few Majors: a stint at the Art Institute of Seattle for Game Art & Design; Global Studies(PoliSci) at the UW. Inevitably - after all that - Computer Science drew me back to itself after my own personal Odyssey, and I think it's where I'll stay.

> Hope to make your acquaintance soon!
