**About me:**

Until last Wednesday, I worked in the marketing department of a tech company in Bellevue called Smartsheet (online project management software - woo hoo!).
I'm excited to start this new adventure and can't wait to learn the ins and outs of being a developer!

My hair is a different color now, but here's the most recent / most professional photo I have.

...And here's a picture of my cat, Solo, because she's tiny and adorable and adventurous.
