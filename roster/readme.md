# Add your own folder here

Follow these instructions carefully to complete your first git assignment.

Send a Pull Request that adds your own folder to the `roster` directory here. Your folder should be named with your GitHub username.

Inside your folder should be a single readme.md file. Be careful not to overwrite **this** readme.md file, nor the one in the project root directory. Create your readme.md file in your own folder. Write into it some basic info about you, nicely formatted in [MarkDown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/). Include your GitHub username, linked to your GitHub profile. Also link to your Twitter account, your LinkedIn page, a favorite photo, and any other relvant information or online presence you'd like to share with your classmates.

Your Pull Request should come from a fork of this repo. Your changes should be done on a branch off of `master`.

You can view my example folder [here](https://github.com/codefellows/sea-b28-foundations/tree/master/roster/brookr).
