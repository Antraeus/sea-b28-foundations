# About Me

I am originally from Orange County, CA, but moved to Seattle 3 years ago. I moved to this city for better opportunities and of course, the lifestyle that this city has to offer. I graduated from California State University-Fullerton in 2008 with a degree in Finance. Obviously, I took a different route. During the time I was preparing to enroll in M.B.A. programs I came to realize just how much technology intrigues me, hench my career choice.

As of a few weeks go, I was working for a bank in Downtown Seattle as a Systems Administrator. During my time there, I realized I was no longer being challenged or even enjoyed what I was doing. I've always had a curious eye towards programming, but never had the courage to take a leap. Just recently, I quit my job and decided to attend Code Fellows bootcamp to change my career and hopefully become an App Developer.

I am looking forward to our journey!
